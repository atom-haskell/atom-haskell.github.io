      <description>Refer to Atom Flight Manual section on packages for more detailed information
 You can find a complete list of Atom-Haskell packages on atom.io package registry
 There are binary dependencies which are not touched upon in this section. Refer to next section for a guide.
 Pick-and-choose approach You can pick and choose what packages you want and do not want to install. However, bear in mind that language-haskell is absolutely mandatory, and ide-haskell is most likely required too.</description>

      <description>Supported ghc-mod versions are 5.6. and up.
 These instructions assume you want to use stylish-haskell as a prettifier. If you would like to use hindent or brittany instead, substitute that in place of stylish-haskell below.
Bear in mind that prettifier has to be able to work as a unix filter, i.e. accept input on STDIN and return output on STDOUT.
 The Atom-Haskell packages (and this instructions) assume that you have at least a minimal Haskell toolchain installed on your system.</description>
